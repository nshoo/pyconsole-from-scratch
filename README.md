# pyconsole-from-scratch

PyConsoleFromScratch is an attempt to create a working terminal emulator from scratch, for Windows. The goal of this project is to create an easily customizable and hackable learning tool. The program utilizes a tkinter canvas to draw it's graphics, so it's about as simple as it gets.

**Progress**
As of now, the project only consists of a text-engine, which is incomplete.
